# SNAKE!

A super classic game! Surely someone else has already built a terminal based version, but here is my take.
Built in python, a language meant to write a game about reptiles.

## What needs to be done
- [x] add snake movement
- [x] add death by touching walls
- [ ] add user input
- [ ] add food spawning
- [ ] add score

## dependencies

This game currently only requires python =3.10= but it will probably work with older python 3 versions


## what works now
There is no user input yet but you can see the snake move around by
```python
python -m app.main
```
