# SNAKE!

A super classic game! Surely someone else has already built a terminal based version, but here is my take.

## What needs to be done
- [ ] add user input
- [ ] add snake movement
- [ ] add food spawning
- [ ] add score
- [ ] add death by touching walks

## what works now
```python
python -m snake.viz.grid
```
will randomly make the letter `X` move with in the game board.
