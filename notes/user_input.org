#+TITLE: Getting inputs from users

* Overview
Getting inputs from users is harder than I first thought.
** Builtin =input= is not suitable
Python has a built in function, =input=, which is
allows user to type into a buffer. After pressing enter or
return the input is converted into a string (even if it contains digits)
and can be assigned to a variable and used by the rest of the program.
The main issue is that a call to input is blocking and a user must
press return to allow the main program to continue. This won't work
for a game input system.
** OS dependent lower level libraries
