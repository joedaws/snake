#+TITLE: Packaging

* Terminal version
The one I'm currently working on.

* windowed version
I'd also like to build a windowed version that can be distrubted to
other systems and be lauched as an app.

See [[https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/overview/#bringing-your-own-python-executable][this section]] of the ptyhon docs to for options about creating executables
for multiple environments.

Looks like there are libraries depending on the OS.
